  I love mod vanilla by Ariana grande, it's more of a vanilla ice cream on me though so no caramel.

  <details><summary>View replies (12)</summary>

    * **Sophia**:
      mod vanilla is like spicy though
    * **🌸Emily🌸**:
      really? I don't pick up any spicy at all! Just sweet and almost refreshing type of vanilla.
    * **Sophia**:
      nahh like not spicy like jalapenos ofc 😭😭 but like spicy like cinnamon but it doesnt smell like cinnamon at all, ahh idk its hard to explain. also mod vanilla is just my opp, 70$ and it stopped-
    * **Sophia**:
      spraying while completely full and then like dried it self out just mod vanilla hater
    * **🌸Emily🌸**:
      I get what you mean 100%! I have a spicy perfume it's almost like a bit masculine leaning? but yeah the bottle is a nightmare so I get it 💀
    * **lizz**:
      it is not at all
    * **Sophia**:
      to you lizz. to me it is lizz.

  <details><summary>View replies (28)</summary>

    * **〖O〗〖t〗〖t〗〖e〗〖r〗**:
      I have the lotion!! I’m putting eclair on my list too!!
    * **Nina🩷**:
      eclaire is a dupe for bianco latte🙂‍↕️
    * **LaiLah 🩷I content creator**:
      Choco musk it’s so good but it smells even better paired with the eos vanilla cashmere lotion
    * **💟**:
      eclaire is so sweet even smelling it from the bottle leaves my nose smelling like literal vanilla ice cream w caramel drizzle it’s 100% what ur looking for
    * **chandra frança**:
      no really get the eclaire i just smelt it in person for the first time the other day and it’s exactly what you’re looking for it just smells better and better the longer it’s on your skin
    * **Keira ☁️🫧**:
      This combo really is sweetness overload if that's your goal!
    * **Turtle**:
      Yes veryyy sweet and gourmand!!
    * **Sydney Copper**:
      ECLAIR IS THAT GIRL
    * **leena**:
      LATTAFA ECLAIRE IS SOSO GOODD
    * **eden.ab24**:
      I ordered that perfume and it’s supposed to get delivered today! I hope it’s as good as everyone says lmao
    * **Turtle**:
      Omg report back with your thoughts lol
    * **eden.ab24**:
      I got it and love it so far!! I went to target later in the day like 3 hours after spraying it and the cashier told me I smelled good so 10/10 from me lol
    * **Turtle**:
      YAYY love that for you
    * **Michelle 💖**:
      Yes 1mil times yes!!!!
    * **Rissa لا**:
      YES OMGGG
    * **cvpid**:
      i feel like im the only one who really really hates eos vanilla cashmere it smells like burnt plastic to me 🙁
    * **Turtle**:
      Scent is so subjective and personal!! I don’t like the kayali 28 perfume and people rave it’s their fav vanilla
    * **Crestonia**:
      YES THIS
    * **Alexis ❄️**:
      this is my go to and my crush said i smelled edible so i stand by it !

      i was about to say that eos lotion don’t play i can smell it on me rn
    * **Turtle**:
      YES!! Like omg she’s affordable, smells amazing, long lasting, moisturizing but not sticky? Yes maammmm
    * **Monique Lopez**:
      My eclair doesn’t last. Maybe I have a fake
    * **Turtle**:
      Oh noo, I will say that out of all my perfumes it’s not like absolute beast mode. Some of my fragrances last 12+ hrs. But eclair lasts about 6/7 hours on me when sprayed on top of an oil or lotion
    * **Turtle**:
      bestie she said she wanted to smell like frosting, eos vanilla cashmere smells like frosting lmao 😭
    * **viridian_daydream**:
      I do this with Eclair AND heavy cream by Phlur together. It’s so amazing.
    * **Turtle**:
      Ooo that sounds amazing

    * **kathy_nyc**:
      Discovered EOS lotions a couple a month ago now I can’t live without them
    * **bug**:
      there's really just nothing quite like it as far as builability and staying power
    * **Koneko**:
      Sol de janeiro 71 is like mind blowingly good😭 my friends have literally thought someone was baking pastries when I’ve worn it
    * **Galaxy Maverick113**:
      I use eos vanilla cashmere and nemat vanilla together as well. I then layer it with Prada paradoxe intense and Kay ali bum marshmallow. the smell is amazing.
    * **bug**:
      you are absolutely a girlie who gets it, it's a beast mode combo
    * **Shaidaett 🐆💄🎱**:
      If you’re feeling nasty 🤣 SDJ 71 smells like buttery caramel popcorn but it’s so good
    * **bug**:
      it's one I've gone through bottles three or four times over, and all my coats smell like it now even after washes 😅

      i’ve heard if you let it macerate it gets much more intense!
    * **nunyA**:
      Vanilla 28 is musky and the only Kayali Scent I've ever returned
    * **Bri✨**:
      I was excited to buy it and I’m sad I bought the big bottle 😭It’s okay it’s just so woody and musky (kinda a mature scent) and I was just looking for a sweet soft vanilla, creamy scent.
    * **KeeDee**:
      doesn't last on anyone to be that expensive smh
    * **mazzeline🍒🇵🇰**:
      oh my it lasts on me forever idk why it doesn’t last for so many ppl

    * **t.mackkkin**:
      Yesssss my favorite 💜

      It is so pretty, so smooth and lasts so long. Leaves a scent trail for hours after application. Love, worth the hype!
    * **Merry.m8**:
      Don’t blind buy it! I smelled a sample of it and hated it, I would’ve hated spending that much money on a perfume I hate
    * **user67179791236**:
      don’t blind buy!! I recommend trying samples on scent split or lucky scent. Scent split has the actual perfume in a spray so I’d recommend that a little more sometimes dabbers don’t give
    * **user67179791236**:
      the most accurate representation of a fragrance in my opinion!
    * **Lorie_Lola**:
      Lucky scent website offers samples for $5. Try it first, if you must.
    * **Triny**:
      I got a decant of Bianco latte before I bought the full size from scentsplit, but honestly after I tried it I knew I’d love it by the way people described it and it would’ve been a safe blind buy
    * **Chelle**:
      Beware Bianco Latte has a very sharp opening & is super strong! Sample first :)
    * **Han**:
      Lataffa eclaire is said to be a 1:1 dupe
    * **vamp**:
      I think you can buy a sample of it for like $5 on lucky scents
    * **PiscesMoonPJ**:
      BL has a cinnamon note I hate. It’s not warm marshmallow vanilla for me. It’s more horchata.
    * **Shriya**:
      @DIVAIN FRANCE does a dupe! It’s only £12, number 895 - I love it. I don’t know what the OG Bianca latte smellls like, but this smells like cookies and lasts all day!

    * **j**:
      i second this!! the most compliments i’ve ever gotten was when i was wearing mod
    * **y ᱬ**:
      mod vanilla is a clean musky vanilla might not be the best for what she’s asking
    * ***:･ﾟ✧ 𝒕𝒂𝒚𝒍𝒐𝒓 ✧ﾟ･:***:

      mod vanilla is such a sweet vanilla wym
    * **y ᱬ**:
      it’s sweet but has slightly woody musky and fruity notes but the video is asking for like straight up cupcake scents
    * **Haley Plessinger**:
      i love sweet tooth so much but it doesn’t last long. I even looked up what the best places to spray it and it doesn’t last longer than an hour or two on me
    * ***:･ﾟ✧ 𝒕𝒂𝒚𝒍𝒐𝒓 ✧ﾟ･:***:
      ugh that sucks 🥺 i wear it on the skin with lotion/oil then the body mist on clothes

  Eilish lasts forever on skin and clothes if you like that particular fragrance! I know it's a bit divisive cause it goes on so strong and minty. also it's not vanilla but like candied oranges and very sweet and in a similar class to vanilla, Dolce Devotion intense lasts well and doesnt stain clothes. Burberry Goddess also doesn't stain clothes so you can spray some on your collar and it will last days. black opium le parfum DOES stain clothes but I still like to put it on the inside of my sleeve. the real trick for eternal perfume is spraying on the clothes and hair though 😅 and back of the hand/wrist helps too

  I’ll tell you Bianco Latte is probably what you’re looking for but it does have a little hint of straight coffee to it. If you want a caramelized sugar more realistic vanilla vibe, Escapade Gourmand.

    * **Kara**:
      BUT I will say a lot of people have said it makes them smell like play-doh. And it smells more caramel-y on me while Bianco smells more powdery on my skin. Body chemistry does affect the smell!
    * **Kara**:
      But Bianco latte lasts foreverrrrrrr. It stays on the skin until you wash it off. I am not even exaggerating.

  Be sure to buy a sample and test for a week first before making up your mind! perfume usually smells v different on everyone and it also needs time to dry down for you to know how it actually smells.

* **Fallon**:
  straight up, buy either a sample of a good rec here, or cooking extracts, and mix it into a unscented body oil, will last on your skin for years

* **Sara Jo**:

  Look for anything Eau de Parfum and apply body oil, look for sometimes with some more deep notes it will last longer. Sweet sents dont last as long, just because of floral composition.
